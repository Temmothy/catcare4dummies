         In the beginning, cats can be a handful, especially when they're kittens. Caring for a kitten starts with creating a safe, cozy environment. 
         When you first bring your kitten home, they’re likely to be between 6 to 8 weeks old—tiny, curious, and still adjusting to the world. 
         It’s important to kitten-proof your space: hide electrical cords, remove small objects they could swallow, and make sure there’s a warm, quiet area just for them. 
         A soft bed, shallow food and water dishes, and a small litter box are essential starter items. 
         Socialization is also key during this time, so gentle handling, play, and introducing them to different sights and sounds can help build their confidence.

         Nutrition plays a huge role in your kitten’s growth and development. 
         Kittens need food formulated specifically for their age, which contains more protein, fat, and essential nutrients than adult cat food. 
         Feed them several small meals a day, and make sure fresh water is always available. 
         Around 8 to 10 weeks, they should begin to eat solid food comfortably, but it's still best to follow a gradual weaning process if they’re transitioning from milk. 
         Avoid giving them human food or milk—it can upset their stomach and lead to long-term health issues.
